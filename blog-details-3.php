                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="orange-final">Step 1: Form fillup for the NEET UG program:</span>
                                The first step is to apply for the NEET UG exam form. The National Test Agency(NTA) is responsible for conducting the NEET examination across various states in India. NTA is an autonomous organization that works under the Ministry of Education under the Government of India. To stay updated about the dates when the form fillup starts, visit the Official NEET website and fill up the form within the given period.

                            <li>
                                <span class="orange-final">Step 2: Qualify for the NEET examination:</span>

                                <span class="orange-final">Step 3: Select your preferred college:</span>
                                Once you have cleared the NEET examination, it is time to find a preferable medical college for admission suitable for you. According to your NEET score, preferred location, fee structure, and other facilities. The college selection is a critical step as you’ll invest the remaining 5 years here for your degree. Do proper research and select the best possible option available to you.

                                <span class="orange-final">Step 4: Register for counseling and choice filling:</span>
                                Now that you have shortlisted the colleges of your choice, you need to apply for the counseling process. Once you have joined the counseling, fill up the colleges according to your preferences.

                                <span class="orange-final">Step 5: Seat allotment and document verification:</span>
                                Once the counseling process is over and you have your seat allotted in the specific college of your choice, based on your rank, and seat availability, now it is time to visit the college/Authorized Center for document verification. Carry all the original copies of the documents asked for along with the attested copies. Make sure the verification process is correct, or else your seat might get canceled.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="orange-final">Step 6: Payment and seat acceptance:</span>
                                The last step of this process is to submit the fees for your admission to the allotted college. This is the final process for seat acceptance and now you can join your college whenever your college gives you the joining date. By following these simple steps, you can easily get into the Top medical colleges of your choice. However, this process can be overwhelming for many people. For this reason, several well-known organizations like EICS help to simplify the process and help you to make the right decision.
